# libbpc

A top-down backtracking parser combinator system with longest-match disambiguation semantics for alternatives. 

Choosen cursor is about the ease of use and understand over performances.

Because it is a top-down parser implementation, left reccursive grammars will have to be rewritten first before their translation.
